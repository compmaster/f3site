## Installation

Some web servers require `RewriteBase` directive in `.htaccess` files. If you encounter HTTP 500 error or nice URLs don't work for you, then you should try to replace `.htaccess` contents with the following code:

RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule (.+) index.php?go=$1 [L,QSA]
```

## History
This project started in 2005 inspired by jPortal, PHP-Fusion, Joomla! and other content management systems used these days. The main idea was to create a CMS that has low hardware requirements and works fast on free hostings.

Versions 1.x stored content in .php files and did not need any database. Since version 2.x server had to support MySQL or SQLite. Version 3.0 was the milestone with rebuilt architecture, advanced template system and many new features.

Version 3.1 supported nice URLs, tags and integrated anti-spam systems. Version 3.2 introduced modern layout. Version 3.3 with major security fixes and UI improvements was never finished. As market expectations changed and minor content management systems lost the battle with fully modular ones and more specialized solutions, this project was abandoned.
